## April 1

[Ethereum Merge](./ethereum.md#merge) currently tested on the Kiln Testnet. It would be interesting to
run the EL/CL nodes.

[Shanghai Network](./ethereum.md#shanghai) has EIPs Considered For Inclusion.
Would be interesting to see what changes it implements.

### Sway Language   

Continuing with the [Sway
Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/introduction/overview.html).

When compiling `wallet_contract` received 94 errors from `sway-lib-std`. Tried
reinstalling `forc` and `fuel-core` but still got the same
[errors](./assets/forc_error.txt).

### Sway Language

After updating `forc` to version `0.11.0` I was able to compile the
`wallet_contract` correctly.

> Why is it necessary to create a script in order to call a contract?

Next [Tuesday](#may-2) I will continue looking at the [Sway
Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/introduction/sway-toolchain.html).

### Dotfiles

Today I'm creating a very simple
[dotfiles](https://github.com/bobincrypto/dotfiles) repository only containing a few
lines configuring vim.

Possibly would be good to read the [Learn Vimscript the Hard
Way](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/) book in future
streams.
