# 2022

## March 29 - Setting up my website

- Setup my [website](https://bobincrypto.github.io)
- Read about [Mina Protocol](./mina.md)

## April 1 - Ethereum Merge

[Ethereum Merge](./ethereum.md#merge) currently tested on the Kiln Testnet. It would be interesting to
run the EL/CL nodes.

[Shanghai Network](./ethereum.md#shanghai) has EIPs Considered For Inclusion.
Would be interesting to see what changes it implements.

## April 8 - Sway Language and FuelVM

### Sway Language

- [Sway Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/)

Is this similar to [Fe Language](https://fe-lang.org/)?

Specific for the Fuel Blockchain (not EVM Compatible)

### FuelVM

- Instructions (32-bits / 4 bytes)
    - Opcode: 8bits
    - Register: 6bits
    - Immediate value: 12/18/24 bits (depending on operation)

- Registers (64bits / 8bytes)
- Words (64 bits)
- Storage (Persistent State) 32-byte (256bits)
    - Committed into a Sparse Binary Merkle Tree.

## April 26 - Sway Language   

Continuing with the [Sway
Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/introduction/overview.html).

When compiling `wallet_contract` received 94 errors from `sway-lib-std`. Tried
reinstalling `forc` and `fuel-core` but still got the same
[errors](./assets/forc_error.txt).

## April 27 - Sway Language

After updating `forc` to version `0.11.0` I was able to compile the
`wallet_contract` correctly.

> Why is it necessary to create a script in order to call a contract?

Next [Tuesday](#may-04---sway-language) I will continue looking at the [Sway
Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/introduction/sway-toolchain.html).

## April 28 - Setting up my dotfiles

Today I'm creating a very simple
[dotfiles](https://github.com/bobincrypto/dotfiles) repository only containing a few
lines configuring vim.

Possibly would be good to read the [Learn Vimscript the Hard
Way](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/) book in future
streams.

## May 4 - Sway Language

Looked at the language basics, it looks very similar to Rust. 

- Can **Contract B** call **Contract A** if I don't have **Contract A**'s
  code?.
